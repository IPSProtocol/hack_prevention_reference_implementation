# IPSChain Reference Implementation
This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of documented hack scenarios that have occurred in the past. It is designed to demonstrate how these exploits can be effectively prevented using the IPSChain decentralized firewall technology.

The primary goal of this repository is to educate developers, security researchers, and enthusiasts on the importance of robust contract implementations and the innovative solutions provided by IPSChain. By replicating past hacks, users can learn from historical vulnerabilities, ensuring better security in future decentralized applications.

## Contents of the Repository
For each documented exploit, the repository includes the following components:

- Victim Contracts: These are the decentralized application contracts that were compromised.
Attack Contract Implementation: This contains the implementation details of a contract designed to replicate the hack.
- Firewall Contract: A specialized contract on the IPSChain that is capable of identifying and preventing the documented hack.
- Deployment Script: We provide a Hardhat script that automates the deployment of the contracts and the execution of the hack on a local blockchain simulation (local chain).
