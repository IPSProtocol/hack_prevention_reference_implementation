# Decentralized Firewall: Enabling Reliable, Decentralized, Scalable, Deterministic and Unavoidable Hack Prevention for Smart Contracts 

## Overview

This repository showcases various **hack scenarios** and demonstrates how they can be **avoided** by leveraging our **Firewall Contract**, the core of the **Decentralized Firewall**. It serves as the reference implementation for documented historical smart contract exploits and includes scripts to reproduce these scenarios. The goal is to highlight how these exploits can be effectively prevented using the **IPSProtocol Decentralized Firewall Technology**, which is pluggable into any EVM-compatible blockchain.

---

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository is to **educate and empower developers, security researchers, and blockchain enthusiasts** by introducing a new paradigm: **dynamic security analysis** that enables **hack prevention** in a decentralized, transparent, and deterministic manner.

## Contents of the Repository

For each documented exploit, the repository includes the following components:

- **Vulnerable Contracts**: These are the decentralized application contracts that were compromised.
- **Attacking Contract Implementation**: This contains the implementation details of a contract designed to replicate the hack.
- **Firewall Contract**: A specialized contract managed by the Decentralized Firewall, executed at the end of the transaction, that is capable of identifying and preventing the documented hack. For more details about the Firewall Contracts and the Decentralized Firewall Technology, check out [here](https://docs.ipsprotocol.xyz).
- **Hack Simulation Script**: We provide a Hardhat task that automates the deployment of smart contracts and execution of the hack on Ethereum testnet and the Decentralized Firewall Testnet.

## Getting Started

**Step 1** Install Node v18.18.2 or v20.12.2 (LTS) - [Download site](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

**Step 2** Install Hardhat 2.22.3 - [Guide](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#installation)

**Step 3** Install the project's dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

**Step 4** Contact the Decentralized Firewall Team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/k4Q5JspK) or [Telegram](https://t.me/+hSp2Kr_exIc5ZDA0) to request:
1. Decentralized Firewall credentials for RPC Node connectivity.
2. Gas tokens by providing your wallet address.

## Hardhat Configuration

#### Configuration variables

1. Ensure that you create an `.env` file in the project root directory containing the following variables:
```bash
$ touch .env
```
2. Configure the `.env` file:
```
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=XXXXX
DECENTRALIZE_FIREWALL_USERNAME=XXXXX
DECENTRALIZE_FIREWALL_PASSWORD=XXXXX
PRIVATE_KEY=XXXXX
```

3. Import the variables in the Hardhat configuration file `hardhat.config.js`:

-`SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` enabling RPC connection with SEPOLIA Testnet. Usually setup with Infura or Alchemy.

- `DECENTRALIZE_FIREWALL_USERNAME` and `DECENTRALIZE_FIREWALL_PASSWORD` should be provided by the **Decentralized Firewall Team**.
- `PRIVATE_KEY` should be the private key of a wallet you'll be using for testing the Decentralized Firewall Network. The **Decentralized Firewall Team** will send you gas tokens.
-

The following two variables are used in the `run_nft_reentrancy.js` file:
- `KEYSTORE_PATH`: This variable specifies the path to the keystore that you have created locally for your private key.
- `LOCAL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: This variable holds the password required to access the keystore and retrieve your private key.

```javascript
const { DECENTRALIZED_FIREWALL_USERNAME, DECENTRALIZED_FIREWALL_PASSWORD, SEPOLIA_RPC_URL, PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;
```

### Decentralized Firewall Configuration

1. Add the Decentralized Firewall Configuration in the Hardhat config file: `hardhat.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.24",
  networks: {
    decentralized_firewall_testnet: {
      url: `https://${DECENTRALIZED_FIREWALL_USERNAME}:${DECENTRALIZED_FIREWALL_PASSWORD}@ipschain.ipsprotocol.xyz`,
      accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    },
    local: {
      url: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`,
      accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],
      timeout: 1800000 // 30 minutes, if applicable for your specific debugging tools or scripts
    },
    sepolia: {
      url: `${SEPOLIA_RPC_URL}`,
      accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],
      timeout: 1800000 // 30 minutes, if applicable for your specific debugging tools or scripts
    },
    node: {
      url: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`,
    }
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      decentralized_firewall_testnet: "let_him_cook"
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: "decentralized_firewall_testnet",
        chainId: 8337,
        urls: {
          apiURL: "https://explorer.ipsprotocol.xyz/api",
          browserURL: "https://explorer.ipsprotocol.xyz"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```
## Running Scenarios

Running scenarios for now displays information on the terminal about the hack execution.

### Locally with Hardhat Node

1. Open a terminal and start a Hardhat node:
```bash
$ npx hardhat node
```
2. Run the NFT Reentrancy Reference implementation scenario on Hardhat:
```bash
$ npx hardhat hack-nft --network node --tokens 5
```

When running an NFT reentrancy hack on Hardhat, you will observe that the hack succeeds and the hacker is able to buy 1 NFT and collect 5.

```text
4 - Attack vulnerable Claim function!

Claiming Tx Hash: 0xac04660bc485da5cd5ff3eee9a9e0318dc15093652a663249fce97baa300ed93
Claiming NFT Passed: true
Number of Claimed NFTs : 5
________________________
```

### Decentralized Firewall Network

Run the scenarios on our Decentralized Firewall Network:
```bash
$ npx hardhat nft-hack --network decentralized_firewall_testnet --tokens 5
```

When running an NFT reentrancy hack on the Decentralized Firewall Testnet, you will observe that the hack is prevented:

```text
3 - Attacker buys 1 NFT

4 - Attacks vulnerable Claim Function

Claiming Tx Hash: 0x09fab0bb99c42a6be8b8fad8918d0157e6463c2669e6fbc687d1872cfdc174d6
Claiming NFT Passed: False

Revert reason: DecentralizedFirewall: Invariant: Should Buy Before Claiming

________________________
```

While running on our Decentralized Firewall Network, the hack is effectively prevented.

Please review the transaction that was reverted by searching for the transaction hash on our [explorer](https://explorer.ipsprotocol.xyz).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Not only was the hack reverted, but the malicious transaction was also recorded on the blockchain, complete with all its details about the user that attempted to exploit the system, the contract logic, execution, and emitted events. This provides valuable insights into potential vulnerabilities for decentralized applications. Monitoring projects can now focus on alerting about attempted hacks. Thanks to our hack prevention capabilities, they will be able to take their time to identify the vectors of attack used, assess the risks, and evaluate whether to provide a fix or update the firewall contracts and invariants logic for long-term security against new attack vectors.

## (Optional) Metamask setup

After obtaining your chain credentials, you can set up your Metamask wallet to check the gas tokens and manage them accordingly. Once you receive your credentials, set the URL with your values:

```
https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@ipschain.ipsprotocol.xyz
```

ChainId: 8337
